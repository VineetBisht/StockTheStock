# Project-Brogrammers [Phase 3 Complete]
All the files for the backend as well as the fxml GUI has been created by the combined effort of all the team members. Some extra features such as password encryption have also been added.

Phase 3 has been completed successfully where all the controllers contain their method bodies as well as the operations on the database. The controllers have their events linked to the database through the class previously created in phase 2. 

Latest changes to the project will be listed in the commit messages.
