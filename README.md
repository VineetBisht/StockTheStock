## About The Project

[![Stock the Stock][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This was an ambitious project as we had undertaken a lot of functionalities for it when compared to the duration.

Why you should use this:
* It helps you manage you stock.
* Helps manage the employees that would operate on this stock for transactions. 
* Helps the manager manage the employees:

Of course, its not a perfect project but we have given it our best.
